This repository contains the materials used in the 28 September 2019 Introduction to R Workshop offered as a continuing education course at AFS in Reno, NV.

### Set Up Instructions  

1. [Install R](https://www.r-project.org/)  
- If you are using Windows, you can do this simply by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm). If you are using Mac or Linux, you can follow [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), select the location nearest to your institution to access the files you will need to download. You should have R version 3.6.1.  

2. Install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) by selecting the 1.2.5001 version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux/Ubuntu).  

*Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.*  

3. Download the files contained in [the current repository](https://github.com/DanielleQuinn/AFS_IntroR) by clicking the green button that says "Clone or Download" and selecting "Download ZIP".  

4. Unzip these files into a folder on your Desktop called "AFS_IntroR"
